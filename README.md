In this project we are running a weather analysis in Hawaii island before deciding to open a surf and ice-cream shop. The kind of investment is highly dependent on weather condition of the island we are interested, and a good weather analysis will help our investors have an informed decisions of the incoming business opportunity.   
## Overview of the Analysis

   * The overview and purpose of the analysis can be summarized as:
   - To analyze the weather data of Hawaii islands before deciding to open a surf and ice-cream shop
   - To specifically analyze June and December temperature of the islands
   - To provide statistical measure of central tendencies
   - To provide the analyzed data on a Flask web browser
## Results and Analysis

   * At the onset of the analysis, we were able to plot the temperature analysis as shown below.


   * We also extracted the temperature analysis of June:


   * Then, we also calculated the measure of central tendencies for month of June.


   * Later, we also analyzed the temperature records of December.


   * Then, we also calculated the measure of central tendencies for the month of December.


## Summary and conclusion

   * Finally, it can be summarized and concluded as:
   - Measure of central tendencies gave us great result where June average temp was 75F and Dec average temp was 71F.
   - Thus, it can be concluded as, the Hawaii island where the analysis was done is a great place to open the surf shop.

## Recommendations
   * From the analysis, we can comfortably recommend the analysis to be repeated on other neighboring islands and push for more surf shops in other locations.
